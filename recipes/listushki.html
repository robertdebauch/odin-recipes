    <h2>What is Listhuski and how to make it?</h2>
    <p>You can try leaflets among the southern Komi. Their whole secret is in the "pan" made from a cabbage leaf. You
        put a leaf with dough in the oven and take out a loaf. Housewives in Komi villages baked "tup√∂s nyan" - hearth
        bread. And they put a cabbage leaf under the dough as a frying pan - hence the Russian name "leaflets". The leaf
        burns, they throw it away, and the bread stays clean. And not just clean, but patterned: when baked, it gets a
        hint of flavor, and cabbage juice, and most importantly - <em>beauty</em>.</p>
    <p>In addition to flour, its base is milk, kefir or sour milk of your choice, and even better - whey from homemade
        cottage cheese. We add yeast, sugar, salt, vegetable or butter, if you want it tastier, and wheat flour. Mix,
        put in a warm place, knead, add a little flour. And you can bake.</p>
