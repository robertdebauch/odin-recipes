            <h2>What is Listhuski and how to make it?</h2>
            <p>You can try leaflets among the southern Komi. <strong>Their whole secret is in the "pan" made from a
                    cabbage
                    leaf.</strong> You
                put a leaf with dough in the oven and take out a loaf. Housewives in Komi villages baked <span
                    class="accent">"tup√∂s nyan"</span> -
                hearth
                bread. And they put a cabbage leaf under the dough as a frying pan - hence the Russian name "leaflets".
                The leaf
                burns, they throw it away, and the bread stays clean. And not just clean, but patterned: when baked, it
                gets a
                hint of flavor, and cabbage juice, and most importantly - <span class="accent">beauty</span>.</p>
            <p>In addition to flour, its base is milk, kefir or sour milk of your choice, and even better - whey from
                homemade
                cottage cheese. We add yeast, sugar, salt, vegetable or butter, if you want it tastier, and wheat flour.
                Mix,
                put in a warm place, knead, add a little flour. And you can bake.</p>
