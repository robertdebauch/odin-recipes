    <h2>What is Shan'gi and how to make it?</h2>
    <p>Shan'ga is a dish of Russian, Mari, Udmurt and Komi cuisine. It is a product made from unleavened or yeast,
        wheat, rye or rye-wheat dough. The dish has spread from Karelia to the Ob, including the Russian North.
        Currently, it is typical for the regions of the Urals, Middle Urals and Trans-Urals.</p>
    <p>To prepare it in Komi style, you need <em>rye dough, filling and love</em>. From the dough, we make
        molds with sides, similar to a miniature <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_amazonica"
            target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria Amazonica</a> water lily. We fill it with fillings:
        potato,
        cabbage, cottage cheese, berry, cereal or salted mushrooms. We wait until the wood in the oven burns out, rake
        the coals to the sides and put the baking sheets in the oven. Five minutes - and ruddy, delicious shangi appear
        on the shovel from the oven.</p>
